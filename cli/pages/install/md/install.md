# Installer

You are well on your way to training your very own TensorFlow object detection models! To get started, simply click the install button and sit back as we do the rest. While you wait, feel free to read through some of our documentation.

## Installation FAQ

### Help! A random webpage just opened

During a period of the install, you will most likely be redirected to NVIDIA's developer site to install cudNN. This is completely normal, as cudNN downloads are locked behind NVIDIA's free, but annoying developer program. Simply sign up, and then download the linked file into the root directory of this project. Don't worry if you accidentally closed it, simply follow this
[link.](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/compute/cudnn/secure/8.9.6/local_installers/12.x/cudnn-local-repo-ubuntu2204-8.9.6.50_1.0-1_amd64.deb/)

### I want to see the output of the install script

To view the real-time output of the installation, simply press `L` on your keyboard to open the log window. To view the full output, navigate to the `_install.log` file in the `logs` directory.

## Preface

This framework is designed so teams are able to train fully fledged tensorflow models on local machines instead of using FIRST's ftcml in the cloud. This is only helpful if a member has a powerful enough pc with a GPU. Otherwise I recommend that you use ftcml instead. This program has been updated to make the user experience much better. With that said, it still will require at least some technical know-how as problems will arise.
